XDR System Documentation
1. Overview
This document outlines the functionality and capability of the XDR (Extended Detection and Response) system, designed for cybersecurity monitoring, ethical hacking, reverse engineering, and remote forensic investigations. The system integrates data collection, analysis, and report generation with a focus on detecting suspicious activities across endpoints, networks, and cloud environments. It automates forensic reporting with DOCX and XLSX output formats.

2. System Components
2.1 Cross-Platform Support
The XDR system is designed to work on multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, and macOS. It checks the platform before installing dependencies and adjusts the installation procedure accordingly. The system installs necessary libraries and tools for each platform, ensuring compatibility for networking, ethical hacking, reverse engineering, and remote forensics.
2.2 Dependency Management
The XDR system automatically installs required Python libraries and external tools based on the detected platform. Python libraries such as 'python-docx', 'openpyxl', and 'pandas' are used for report generation. External tools like 'nmap', 'Wireshark', and 'Volatility' are installed for network scanning, traffic analysis, and memory forensics.
2.3 Forensic Data Collection
The system is designed to collect forensic data from network scans, memory dumps, and log files. It integrates with tools such as 'nmap' for network scanning, 'Volatility' for memory analysis, and 'Wireshark' for packet capture analysis. Collected forensic data is compiled into detailed reports for analysis.
3. Report Generation
3.1 DOCX Reports
Forensic reports are generated in the DOCX format using the 'python-docx' library. The reports contain details such as the type of incident, affected systems, timestamps, and a summary of the collected forensic data. The report also includes tables for easy viewing of key forensic data points.
3.2 XLSX Reports
In addition to DOCX reports, the XDR system generates forensic data in the XLSX format using the 'pandas' and 'openpyxl' libraries. The XLSX reports contain structured data, including IP addresses, file access logs, and network traffic details, which can be further analyzed using Excel or similar spreadsheet tools.
3.3 Automated Report Generation
Reports are automatically generated once an incident is detected or forensic data has been collected. The XDR system creates both DOCX and XLSX files, which are saved in a designated directory for further investigation. The reports can be used by security analysts to quickly assess incidents and plan appropriate response measures.
